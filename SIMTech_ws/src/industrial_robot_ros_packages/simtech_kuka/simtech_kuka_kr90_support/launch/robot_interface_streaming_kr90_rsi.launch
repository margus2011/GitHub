  Manipulator specific version of 'robot_interface_streaming.launch'.
  Defaults provided for KR 90 r2700:
   - 6 joints

  Usage:
    robot_interface_streaming_kr90.launch robot_ip:=<value>


  NOTE: this is a convenience wrapper launch file intended to emulate a
  typical ROS-Industrial robot support package variant specific 'robot
  interface streaming' setup. It depends on the main 'robot interface
  streaming' launch file provided by the kuka_rsi_hw_interface package.

  This emulation is not complete (see the robot_interface_streaming.launch
  file in the kuka_rsi_hw_interface package for more comments): starting
  this launch file on its own for instance does not work, while that is
  possible with industrial_robot_client-based ROS-Industrial drivers.
